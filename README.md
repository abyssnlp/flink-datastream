Stream Processing with Apache Flink
===

This repository contains code for the Stream Processing with Apache Flink series on [UnskewData](https://unskewdata.com/blog).


1. [Flink Datastream Introduction](./flink-datastream-demo/)
2. [Flink Datastream Enrichment](./flink-datastream-enrichment/)

Each directory contains a separate Flink project with its own dependencies and `README.md` that explains the project in detail. The projects are built using Maven.
